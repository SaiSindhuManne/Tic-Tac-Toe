**Tic Tac Toe Application**

**Project Overview**

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to play against each other, taking turns to mark "X" or "O" on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all cells are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
